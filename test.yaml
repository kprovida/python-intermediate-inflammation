Introduction
So far we have been manually running our tests as we require. Once we have made a change, or added a new feature with accompanying tests, we can re-run our tests, giving ourselves (and others who wish to run them) increased confidence that everything is working as expected. Now we are going to take further advantage of automation in a way that helps testing scale across a development team with very little overhead, using Continuous Integration.

What is Continuous Integration?
The automated testing we have done so far only takes into account the state of the repository we have on our own machines. In a software project involving multiple developers working and pushing changes on a repository, it would be great to know holistically how all these changes are affecting our codebase without everyone having to pull down all the changes and test them. If we also take into account the testing required on different target user platforms for our software and the changes being made to many repository branches, the effort required to conduct testing at this scale can quickly become intractable for a research project to sustain.

Continuous Integration (CI) aims to reduce this burden by further automation, and automation - wherever possible - helps us to reduce errors and makes predictable processes more efficient. The idea is that when a new change is committed to a repository, CI clones the repository, builds it if necessary, and runs any tests. Once complete, it presents a report to let you see what happened.

There are many CI infrastructures and services, free and paid for, and subject to change as they evolve their features. We will be looking at GitHub Actions - which unsurprisingly is available as part of GitHub.

Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions
A Quick Look at YAML
YAML is a text format used by GitHub Action workflow files. It is also increasingly used for configuration files and storing other types of data, so it is worth taking a bit of time looking into this file format.

YAML (a recursive acronym which stands for “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”) is a language designed to be human readable. A few basic things you need to know about YAML to get started with GitHub Actions are key-value pairs, arrays, maps and multi-line strings.

So firstly, YAML files are essentially made up of key-value pairs, in the form key: value, for example:

YAML
name: Kilimanjaro
height_metres: 5892
first_scaled_by: Hans Meyer
In general, you do not need quotes for strings, but you can use them when you want to explicitly distinguish between numbers and strings, e.g. height_metres: "5892" would be a string, but in the above example it is an integer. It turns out Hans Meyer is not the only first ascender of Kilimanjaro, so one way to add this person as another value to this key is by using YAML arrays, like this:

YAML
first_scaled_by:
- Hans Meyer
- Ludwig Purtscheller
An alternative to this format for arrays is the following, which would have the same meaning:

YAML
first_scaled_by: [Hans Meyer, Ludwig Purtscheller]
If we wanted to express more information for one of these values we could use a feature known as maps (dictionaries/hashes), which allow us to define nested, hierarchical data structures, e.g.

YAML
